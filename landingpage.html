        <div class="kapha_heading">KAPHA DOSHA</div>
        <div class="kapha_description">Kapha dosha is the Ayurvedic mind-body element associated
            with earth and water. It’s slow, moist, cool, oily, heavy, smooth, and steady in nature and embodies structure, lubrication, and stability in the mind and body.
           <br><br>Are you feeling sluggish and unmotivated lately? Do you crave sweets, gain weight just by looking at food, and have a hard time shedding pounds? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions, you might have a Kapha dosha imbalance—or, you might be a Kapha dosha mind-body type.
           If you have a predominantly Kapha constitution, the qualities of Kapha (slow, steady, moist, smooth, oily, cool, heavy) will be expressed in your mind and body.</div>

        <div class="pitt_heading">PITTA DOSHA</div>
        <div class="pitta_discription">Pitta dosha is the Ayurvedic mind-body element associated with fire and water.<br><br>
            Do you often feel hot, irritable, or “hangry?” Is your skin sensitive or prone to breakouts, rashes, and irritation? Do you sometimes have excess stomach acid or trouble falling asleep at night? If some of these things sound familiar, you might have a Pitta dosha imbalance—or, you might be a fiery, passionate Pitta dosha mind-body type.
            <br>One of the foundational principles of Ayurveda is that “like increases like,” and opposites balance. Therefore, because Pitta dosha is hot, sharp, and oily in nature, it benefits from things that are cooling and soothing.</div>

        <div class="vata_heading">VATA DOSHA</div>
        <div class="vata_discription">Vata dosha is the Ayurvedic mind-body element associated with air and space. It’s light, cool, and dry in nature, and it governs all movement and processes in your mind and body—including processes like blood flow, elimination, breathing, and the movement of thoughts in your mind.<br><br>
            If you have a predominantly Vata constitution, the qualities of Vata dosha (light, cool, dry, quick) will be noticeably expressed in your mind and body. Your body is probably naturally thin and slender. Your hands and feet may tend to get cold easily, and your skin is cool and dry to the touch (especially in your extremities). Your sleep may sometimes be a bit elusive, or easily disturbed.</div>
